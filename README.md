# GoodData Sample Downloader
This repository contains a sample downloader for the GoodData connectors infrastructure.

It was created as a possible starting template for implementing a new downloader. Please refer to the 
[GoodData Connectors SDK documentation](https://github.com/gooddata/gooddata_connectors_sdk "GoodData Connectors SDK") for detailed information.

The name and identifier 'dummy', which is used throughout the downloader and brick, is to be replaced with your unique 6-or-less character downloader identifier. 
The name is used in class names and calls as well, make sure to replace all occurrences.
